Hangman Game

User can define the length of the word and the number of attempt errors.
Default length of the word is 7 and default number of attemp errors is 5.

I decided to use the Wordnik API to get a random word of a defined length.

User has to guess the word letter by letter. The letter history for a game is
saved. If the user guess a letter twice, the game shows the related message and
no attempts are discounted from attempts remaining. If the letter is in the
target word, no attemps are dicounted from attempts remaining.
