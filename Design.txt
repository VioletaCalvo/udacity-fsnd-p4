Hangman Game

User can define the length of the word and the number of attempt errors.
Default length of the word is 7 and default number of attempt errors is 5.

I decided to use the Wordnik API to get a random word of a defined length.
https://www.wordnik.com/

User has to guess the word letter by letter. The letter history for a game is
saved. If the user send a letter twice for the same game, the game shows the
related message and no attempts are discounted from attempts remaining. If the
letter is in the target word, no attempts are substracted from attempts
remaining.

Send remainder email Cron job has been modified to send an email every day at
16:00 only if the user has incompleted games.
